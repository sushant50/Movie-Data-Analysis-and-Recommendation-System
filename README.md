# Movie-Data-Analysis-and-Recommendation-System
This project is aimed at creating a Movie Data Analysis and Recommendation System. The system’s task is to recommend movies to the user by finding other users with similar interests, analyzing their behaviour, and recommending our user the same movies. The system can also find movies similar to ones which the user selected/watched earlier, and recommend movies which are like them.
Recommendation systems enable quick filtering of movies to suit the user’s liking.
